## Preparing a new project

1. Make sure you have an LTS version of Node.js installed on your computer.
   [Download and install](https://nodejs.org/en/) if needed.
2. Install the project's dependencies in the terminal with the `npm install` command.
3. Start development mode by running the `npm start` command.
4. Go to [http://localhost:1234](http://localhost:1234) in your browser.

## Files and folders

- All stylesheet parshas should be in the `src/sass` folder and imported into the page stylesheets. For example, for `index.html` the style file is named `index.scss`.
- Add images to the `src/images` folder. The assembler optimizes them, but only when deploying the production version of the project. All this happens in the cloud so as not to burden your computer, as it can take a long time on weak machines.
